## Learning Resources

### YouTube Channels

There are a number of good resources out there to learn Python. Iâ€™d like to highlight Bucky Roberts at thenewboston on youtube. His channel for Python3 can be found at [theNewBoston](https://tinyurl.com/p8n5668).
He has numerous tutorials on web design and numerous other programming languages as well. His Python section currently offers 56 videos. Check it out and let me know what you think.

### PyVideo

[Pyvideo.org](pyvideo.org) is a free volunteer-driven resource which indexes video from events all over the world. You can get a glimpse of what they have already at their [events page](http://pyvideo.org/events.html).
