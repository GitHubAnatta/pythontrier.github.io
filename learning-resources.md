## Learning Resources

There are a number of good resources out there to learn Python. This issue, Iâ€™d like to highlight Bucky Roberts at
thenewboston on youtube. His channel for Python3 can be found at: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/p8n5668">https://tinyurl.com/p8n5668</a>.
He has numerous tutorials on web design and numerous other programming languages as well. His Python section
currently offers 56 videos. Check it out and let me know what you think.
