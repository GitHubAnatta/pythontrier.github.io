<h2>Learning Resources</h2>

    <p>
    There are a number of good resources out there to learn Python. This issue, I’d like to highlight Bucky Roberts at thenewboston on youtube. His channel for Python3 can be found at: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/p8n5668">https://tinyurl.com/p8n5668</a>.
    He has numerous tutorials on web design and numerous other programming languages as well. His Python section currently offers 56 videos. Check it out and let me know what you think.

    The group also now has a slack account where people can communicate directly
    about meetings, challenges, or anything else in general. The group is “PythonTrier.slack.com.” Just set up an account and join the group. There are apps available for Android, iPhone, as well as a web App that can be used on most browsers.
