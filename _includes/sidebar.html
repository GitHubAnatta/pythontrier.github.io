<h2>Learning Resources</h2>

<p>
There are a number of good
resources out there to learn
Python. This issue, I’d like to
highlight Bucky Roberts at
thenewboston on youtube. His
channel for Python3 can be found
at: https://tinyurl.com/p8n5668.
He has numerous tutorials on
web design and numerous other
programming languages as well.
His Python section currently offers
56 videos. Check it out and let
me know what you think.

<h2>Group Resources</h2>

<p>
There is a GitHub
account for the group
which can be located at:
https://github.com/PythonTrier
Presentations, newsletters, and
group projects will all be kept
here.
</p>

<p>
The group also now
has a slack account
where people can
communicate directly
about meetings, challenges, or
anything else in general. The
group is “PythonTrier.slack.com.”
Just set up an account and join
the group. There are apps
available for Android, iPhone, as
well as a web App that can be
used on most browsers.
